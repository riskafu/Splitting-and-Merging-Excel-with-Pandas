# Splitting-and-Merging-Excel-with-Pandas

This is sample code on how to split Excel worksheet based on the certain value of a column and how to merge them back in to one workbook with different tab/worksheet. Attached sample data that I used to run the code, based on this data I want to split the excel file based on group column, so I will have different file depends on group name. Additionally, I also merge these separate workbooks into one file in different worksheet/tab.
